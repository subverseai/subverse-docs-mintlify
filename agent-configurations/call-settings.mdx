### Transfer To
Phone number or SIP URI for human agent transfers.

**Format:**
```

OR
sip:1001@127.0.0.1
```

/>

- **Warm Transfer**: Agent stays on line, introduces customer to human agent
- **Cold Transfer**: Agent transfers and disconnects

**Warm Transfer Prompt:**
```
The call has been warm transferred to a human agent. Please give 
the human agent a summary of the conversation so far.
```

### Whisper
Agent whispers to human agent before customer hears them (warm transfer only).

Seconds of silence before agent prompts customer (default: 8).

### Silence Turns
Number of silence periods before taking action (default: 2).

### Max Duration
Maximum call length in seconds (default: 600 = 10 minutes).

**Recommended:** 300-600 seconds for most use cases

### Silence Prompt
What agent says after detecting silence:
```
User has been silent for 8.0 seconds, check on them.
```

### Agent Responsiveness
How quickly agent responds (0-4 scale).

**Settings:**
- **0**: Slow, deliberate responses
- **2**: Normal (recommended)
- **4**: Very fast, immediate responses

### Preemptive Response
Agent starts generating response before customer finishes speaking.
- **Enabled**: More responsive, overlapping conversation
- **Disabled**: Agent waits for complete silence

**Recommended:** Enable to reduce latency
