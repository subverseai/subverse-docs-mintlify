Configure the AI model that powers your agent's intelligence.

### LLM Model
Select the language model for your agent:
- **Google [Gemini 2.5 Flash]**: Fast, cost-effective, good for most use cases
- **OpenAI [GPT-4o]**: Advanced reasoning, best for complex conversations
- **OpenAI [GPT-4o Mini]**: Balanced performance and cost
- **Anthropic [Claude]**: Excellent for nuanced conversations

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Speed**: Gemini Flash for fastest responses
- **Quality**: GPT-4o for highest quality
- **Cost**: Mini models for budget-conscious deployments
- **Language Support**: Check model language capabilities

### Temperature
Controls response creativity and randomness (0.0 to 1.0).

**Settings:**
- **0.0 - 0.3**: Deterministic, consistent responses (recommended for customer service)
- **0.4 - 0.7**: Balanced creativity and consistency (recommended for sales)
- **0.8 - 1.0**: Creative, varied responses (use with caution)

**Recommended:** 0.5 for most use cases

<Tip>
  Lower temperature (0.3-0.5) is recommended for customer-facing agents to ensure consistent, reliable responses.
