## Configuration Best Practices

### Start with Defaults
Begin with recommended settings and adjust based on testing.

### Test After Each Change
Make incremental changes and test to understand impact.

### Monitor Performance
Track metrics like call duration, success rate, and customer satisfaction.

### Iterate Based on Data
Use call recordings and analytics to identify improvement areas.

### Document Your Settings
Keep notes on why you chose specific configurations.

### Use Templates
Save successful configurations as templates for future agents.
