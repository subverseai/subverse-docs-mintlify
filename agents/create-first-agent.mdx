## Step 1: Access the Agents Section

1. Log in to your [SubVerse Dashboard](https://dashboard.subverseai.com)

SubVerse offers two types of agents to suit different use cases:

### Standard Voice Agent
**Best for:**
- Simple, predictable conversations
- FAQ handling
- Structured information delivery
- Quick deployment needs

**Characteristics:**
- Predefined responses and conversation paths
- Faster setup and configuration
- Lower complexity
- Ideal for straightforward customer interactions

### Conversational Flow
**Best for:**
- Complex customer service scenarios
- Dynamic, context-aware interactions
- Sales conversations
- Technical support

**Characteristics:**
- Advanced AI with natural language understanding
- Handles multi-turn conversations
- Adapts to customer intent in real-time
- Requires more detailed configuration

<Tip>
  If you're new to AI agents, start with a **Standard Voice Agent**. You can always create a more advanced Conversational Flow agent once you're comfortable with the platform.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Select a Template (Optional)

### Greeting Message
The first message your agent speaks when the call connects.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep it concise (under 15 seconds)
- Include your company name
- State the purpose clearly
- Be welcoming and professional

### Greeting Type
Choose how the conversation starts:
- **Prompt**: Agent modifies the greeting message to match the agent's identity
- **Say**: Agent says the greeting message exactly as it is

### Who Speaks First
- **SubVerseAI Agent**: Agent initiates the conversation
- **Customer**: Customer speaks first

<Tip>
  For outbound calls, always have the agent speak first. For inbound calls, consider your use case—customer service typically has the agent greet first.
</Tip>

### System Prompt
This is the most critical configuration—it defines your agent's behavior, personality, and capabilities.

**Components of a Good System Prompt:**

1. **Identity**: Who is the agent?
2. **Role**: What is their purpose?
3. **Personality**: How should they communicate?
4. **Capabilities**: What can they do?
5. **Limitations**: What should they avoid?
6. **Instructions**: Specific behavioral guidelines


**Use the "Refine using AI" button** to get AI assistance in creating or improving your system prompt.

## Step 5: Save Your Agent

1. Review all your settings
2. Click the **Save** button in the top-right corner
3. Your agent is now created and ready for configuration

## Quick Tips for Success

### Start Simple
Begin with basic functionality and add complexity gradually. A simple, working agent is better than a complex, problematic one.

### Test Frequently
Make test calls after each configuration change to ensure everything works as expected.

### Iterate Based on Feedback
Listen to call recordings, review transcripts, and continuously improve your agent based on real interactions.

### Use Templates Wisely
Templates are great starting points, but customize them to match your specific business needs and brand voice.

### Monitor Performance
Regularly check your agent's performance metrics and make adjustments to improve success rates.

<Warning>
  Before deploying your agent to production, conduct thorough testing with various scenarios and edge cases. Poor agent performance can negatively impact customer experience.
</Warning>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Overly Long Greetings**
- Keep greetings under 15 seconds
- Get to the point quickly
- Save detailed information for later in the conversation

**Vague System Prompts**
- Be specific about what the agent should do
- Include clear examples of desired behavior
- Define boundaries and limitations

**Skipping Testing**
- Always test before going live
- Try different conversation paths
- Test with various accents and speaking styles

**Ignoring Voice Selection**
- Choose a voice that matches your brand
- Consider your target audience
- Test different voices with sample customers
