# HTTP Basic Auth Credentials

HTTP Basic Auth credentials allow your SubverseAI agents to authenticate with web services using the standard HTTP Basic authentication scheme.

## Overview

HTTP Basic Auth provides access to:
- REST APIs requiring username/password authentication
- Legacy web services
- Simple authentication schemes
- Intranet and internal services
- Development and testing endpoints

## Steps to Create HTTP Basic Auth Credentials

### 1. Identify Basic Auth Requirements
Check your API documentation to confirm it uses HTTP Basic authentication:
- Look for "Basic Authentication" or "HTTP Basic Auth"
- Check for username/password requirements
- Verify the authentication header format

### 2. Get Authentication Credentials
From your service provider, collect:
- **Username**: Your API username or client ID
- **Password**: Your API password or client secret

### 3. Add to SubverseAI
1. Go to **Credentials** in your SubverseAI dashboard
2. Click **Create New Credential**
3. Select **HTTP Basic Auth** from the credential types
4. Enter a name for your credential
5. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Username**: Your API username
   - **Password**: Your API password
6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the credentials work
7. Click **Save Credential**

## Required Fields

- **Name**: A descriptive name for your credential
- **Username**: Your API username or client ID
- **Password**: Your API password or client secret

## Usage Tips

- Use HTTPS endpoints to protect credentials in transit
- Create dedicated API users for SubverseAI access
- Use strong, unique passwords for each service
- Regularly rotate credentials for security

## Troubleshooting

**401 Unauthorized**: Verify username and password are correct

**Invalid Credentials**: Check for typos and ensure credentials are up-to-date

**Connection Failed**: Verify the service URL and network connectivity

**Encoding Issues**: Ensure special characters in credentials are properly handled

## Next Steps

After creating your HTTP Basic Auth credentials:
- Set up authenticated API requests
- Configure secure web service integrations
- Build authentication testing workflows
- Monitor authentication success rates
- Implement credential rotation procedures
