## Outbound trunk
Setup your voice agent to make outgoing calls from your number.
### Create a SIP trunk
1. Buy a virtual number from your cloud telephony service provider.
2. There are 2 methods for authentication: IP whitelisting, or auth credentials.
3. Currently SubVerse SIP server does not have a static IP, so if you opt for the IP route, you need to whitelist all the IP addresses in the range like this: `0.0.0.0/1`, `128.0.0.0/1`.
4. It is recommended that you also setup Auth Username and Password for secure communication.
5. For detailed provider-specific instructions, see our configuration guides for [Twilio](/integrations/telephony-twilio), [Telnyx](/integrations/telephony-telnyx), or [Plivo](/integrations/telephony-plivo).

1. Provide a **Name** for the connection.
2. Input the **Phone Number** with country code.
3. Enter the **SIP Address** or **Termination URI** provided by your telephony provider.
4. Provide **Auth Username** and **Auth Password** for authentication, leave blank if not configured.
5. You can start using this number for making calls through voice agents interface, workflows, or call APIs.

## Inbound trunk
Setup your voice agent to accept incoming calls on your number.
### Create a SIP trunk
1. Buy a virtual number from your cloud telephony service provider.
2. Get your **Origination URI** from the SubVerse Telephony dashboard (it will look like: `sip:xxxxx.sip.livekit.cloud`).
3. Configure an inbound SIP trunk in your provider's dashboard using the Origination URI from SubVerse.
4. It is recommended that you also setup Auth Username and Password for secure communication.
5. For detailed provider-specific instructions, see our configuration guides for [Twilio](/integrations/telephony-twilio), [Telnyx](/integrations/telephony-telnyx), or [Plivo](/integrations/telephony-plivo).

<Tip>
  Use `xxxxxxxxx.india.sip.livekit.cloud` for region pinning to India SIP servers.
