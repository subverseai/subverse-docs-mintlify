## Overview

The Schedule Callback Node allows you to schedule follow-up calls with customers, passing additional context from previous interactions. This enables intelligent, context-aware callbacks based on workflow logic.

## Use Cases

- **Unresolved Issues**: Schedule callbacks for issues that couldn't be resolved immediately
- **Customer Requests**: Honor customer requests to be called back at specific times
- **Follow-up Campaigns**: Automated follow-ups after initial contact
- **Dropped Calls**: Reconnect with customers after unexpected disconnections
- **Appointment Reminders**: Schedule reminder calls before appointments
- **Payment Follow-ups**: Call customers about pending payments
- **Survey Callbacks**: Schedule calls to collect feedback
- **Lead Nurturing**: Follow up with leads at optimal times

## Inputs

### **Greetings_message**
Greeting message the voice agent will say to the customer.

**Purpose:**
- Overrides the [initial prompt](/agents/agent-configurations#agent-settings) defined for the agent
- Provides context-specific greeting
- Can be AI-generated or manually written

**Behavior:**
- Can be linked from a previous block (e.g., AI-generated greeting)
- Can be manually written in the node
- Data linkage overrides written text

**Example:**
```
Hello John, this is a follow-up call regarding your support ticket #12345. 
We have an update on your issue.
```

**AI-Generated Example:**
```
Link from AI Query Agent output that generates:
"Hi Jane, I'm calling back as you requested. I have the information 
about the Premium Plan pricing you asked about."
```

### **Conversation_context**
Pass previous conversation context to the voice agent.

**Purpose:**
- Provide continuity between calls
- Give agent full context of previous interactions
- Enable personalized conversations

**What to Include:**
- Previous call transcript

**Example:**
```
Previous Call Summary:
- Customer called about order delay
- Order #ORD-12345 was stuck in shipping

## Workflow Integration

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Post-Call Callback**
```
Incoming Call Node
  ↓
AI Query Agent (analyze if callback needed)
  ↓
Schedule Callback Node (if needed)
```

**Pattern 2: Dropped Call Recovery**
```
Voice Agent Node
  ↓
Smart Filter (check if call duration < 30 seconds)
  ↓
Schedule Callback Node (immediate callback in 5 minutes)
```

**Pattern 3: Time-Based Follow-up**
```
Voice Agent Node
  ↓
AI Query Agent (determine follow-up timing)
  ↓
Schedule Callback Node (schedule based on AI decision)
```

**Pattern 4: Multi-Step Campaign**
```
Upload Data Node
  ↓
Voice Agent Node (initial call)
  ↓
AI Query Agent (analyze outcome)
  ↓
Schedule Callback Node (if not converted)
```

## Best Practices

### Timing
- **Customer Preference**: Honor requested callback times
- **Business Hours**: Always use working hour constraints
- **Timezone Awareness**: Consider customer location
- **Spacing**: Don't schedule too many callbacks close together

### Context
- **Full History**: Include complete previous interaction context
- **Relevant Details**: Only include information needed for the call
- **Clear Summary**: Provide concise context summary
- **Update Regularly**: Ensure context is current

### Personalization
- **Use Names**: Include customer name in greeting
- **Reference History**: Mention previous interactions
- **Specific Purpose**: Clearly state reason for callback
- **Custom Greetings**: Tailor message to situation

### Retry Strategy
- **Reasonable Attempts**: 2-3 retries is usually sufficient
- **Appropriate Spacing**: 1-2 hours between retries
- **Time Limits**: Don't retry beyond same day
- **Alternative Contact**: Consider other channels after failed retries

## Monitoring

### Track Callback Performance

**Metrics to Monitor:**
- **Schedule Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully scheduled callbacks
- **Connection Rate**: Callbacks that successfully connected
- **Completion Rate**: Callbacks that achieved their objective
- **Retry Effectiveness**: Success rate of retry attempts

### Analyze Patterns

**Look For:**
- **Optimal Timing**: When callbacks are most successful
- **Context Impact**: How context affects outcomes
- **Retry Patterns**: Which retries succeed
- **Failure Reasons**: Why callbacks fail

## Troubleshooting

### Callback Not Scheduling

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid Scheduled_Time format
- Time in the past
- Missing required fields

**Solutions:**
- Use ISO 8601 format
- Ensure future timestamp
- Verify all required inputs

### Callback Not Connecting

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid phone number
- Customer unavailable
- Network issues

**Solutions:**
- Validate phone number format
- Set appropriate retry logic
- Check telephony integration

### Wrong Timing

**Possible Causes:**
- Timezone mismatch
- Working hours not set
- Incorrect time calculation

**Solutions:**
- Verify timezone setting
- Set Start/End Working Hours
- Double-check time calculations

<Tip>
  Link the Greetings_message and Conversation_context from AI Query Agent to create intelligent, context-aware callbacks.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Always respect customer preferences for callback timing. Unsolicited calls at inconvenient times can harm customer relationships.
