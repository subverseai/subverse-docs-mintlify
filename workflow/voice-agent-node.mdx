## Workflow Integration

### Connecting with Other Nodes

**From Trigger Nodes:**
- Call API Node → Voice Agent Node
- Upload Data Node → Voice Agent Node
- Incoming Call Node → Voice Agent Node (for callbacks)

**To Function Nodes:**
- Voice Agent Node → Send Email Node (follow-up email)
- Voice Agent Node → Send WhatsApp Node (confirmation message)
- Voice Agent Node → Webhook Node (CRM update)
- Voice Agent Node → Schedule Callback Node (if needed)

**With AI Processing:**
- Voice Agent Node → AI Query Agent Node (analyze call outcome)
- AI Query Agent Node → Voice Agent Node (make decision-based calls)

## Best Practices

### Call Timing
- **Respect Time Zones**: Always set appropriate timezone
- **Business Hours**: Use Start/End Working Hour constraints
- **Spacing**: Don't schedule all calls at once
- **Retry Strategy**: Set reasonable retry intervals

### Personalization
- **Use Customer Data**: Include name and relevant details
- **Context**: Provide conversation context in Customer_Details
- **Dynamic Prompts**: Use Agent_Options for per-call customization
- **Relevant Information**: Only include necessary data

### Quality Assurance
- **Test First**: Make test calls before launching campaigns
- **Monitor**: Check Call History regularly
- **Review Transcripts**: Listen to sample calls
- **Iterate**: Improve based on feedback

### Performance
- **Batch Processing**: Use Upload Data Node for bulk campaigns
- **Rate Limiting**: Don't exceed your concurrent call limit
- **Error Handling**: Set up retry logic for failed calls
- **Monitoring**: Track success rates

## Monitoring Call Performance

### Key Metrics to Track

**Connection Rate**
- Percentage of calls that successfully connected
- Target: >80%
- Low rate indicates phone number or timing issues

**Average Call Duration**
- Typical length of conversations
- Helps identify engagement levels
- Very short calls may indicate problems

**Completion Rate**
- Calls that reached intended outcome
- Based on post-call analysis
- Indicates agent effectiveness

**Retry Success**
- Percentage of retries that succeeded
- Validates retry strategy
- Adjust timing if low

### Analyzing Results

Use the outputs to:
- **Segment Customers**: Group by call outcome
- **Trigger Actions**: Based on call status
- **Update Records**: Send data to CRM
- **Schedule Follow-ups**: For unsuccessful calls
- **Generate Reports**: Export for analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Call Not Connecting

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid phone number format
- Number is unreachable or blocked
- Telephony provider issues
- Insufficient credits

**Solutions:**
